##  OVERVIEW
This course provides the fundamentals for writing sustainable software in Python. The material is based on industry standard curricula and best practices. This course will give a new programmer a strong foundation in and understanding of the basics of Python, enabling them to dive into an existing, large-scale Python codebases and make incremental improvements and changes, as well as to develop new Python scripts for analysis.

## COURSE FORMAT
The course can be customized and varies from 1 to 5-day, on-site boot camps. Each day is broken up into two 3.5-hour modules. Each module consists of a block of lecture and examples, followed by intensive individual and group coding sessions. BDSG instructors will provide feedback, coaching, and suggestions as students work on coding problems.

## INTRODUCTORY PYTHON FOR PROGRAMMERS
For an onsite Intro to Python course, we recommend a four-day course, split into eight sessions. Each session includes a lecture block followed by a coding block. This course focuses on fundamentals for newer Python programmers, as well as providing a strong basis in Python best practices and standards.
